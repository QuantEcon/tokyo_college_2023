## Short description

Increases in computer power and computational tools have transformed economic
research,  as well as many other sciences.  This talk will discuss the ways
that growing computer power has changed economics and finance, and how recent
developments such as deep learning, artificial intelligence and machine
learning might transform it in the future.

## Notes for me

### What do economists do?

* cobweb model - show hog cycle, equations, output and how they depend on expectations.
* economic modeling is hard -- but we shouldn't give up

### Why economists need computers

* Quantitative economics
    * Bellman quote
    * Given an example -- what will be the impact of a 100BPS change in short term rate on unemployment in one year?
    * If you can't say precisely then give probabilities, run scenarios
    * What will be the effect of increasing the income tax rate on govt revenue?  Where are we on the Laffer curve?
    * Repeat Bellman quote
* Simulation
    * Schelling model

### The value of computer power

* Pricing a European option -- compare languages, talk about jit compilers, illustrate with google jax.
* Publishing and communication  -- LaTeX, MyST, etc.

### The limits of computer power

* Linear assignment
* The importance of algorithms
* How algorithms interact with advances in hardware/software

### What about machine learning and AI?

* Why machine learning is not enough -- current inflation unprecedented -- think about that word
* Insufficient and nonstationary data -- forecasting GDP
* The need for careful mathematical modeling
